# RSG
The [Random String Generator project](https://reap.myportfolio.com/random-string-generator) released in 2016.

This code is extremely old, and encompasses my early desire for creating applications at a young age. Began development in 2013, and went through several iterations. I've decided to bring it to GitHub. Demonstrates coding without following any common practices for software development, and just passionate about making something happen.

Features: Ability to generate any string with any character set in unicode.
- Ability to create and generate dictionarys that will be used to generate random words of any length
- Compute permutations of *any set* in actual figures.
- Export any number of iterations to a text file
- Statistics for many of the screens
- and a ton more.
