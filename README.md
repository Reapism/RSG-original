# RSG
The [Random String Generator project](https://reap.myportfolio.com/random-string-generator) released in 2016.

This code is extremely old, and encompasses my early desire for creating applications at a young age. Began development in 2013, and went through several iterations. I've decided to bring it to GitHub.
